 * This functions returns the next word in the text.

 * into which the parser can copy the next word. The word written in
 * nextWord is terminated with a '\0'-character.
 *
 * If the buffer is too short to store the whole next word including
 * a terminating '\0'-character, it will split it and return the 
 * bufferLength-1 long parts of the word.
 *
 * If the end of the text is reached, the return value of the function
 * is zero and nextWord is empty (only a '\0'-character). Otherwise 
 * the return value is non-zero. 
 *
 * The parser assumes that a word consists only of the letters A-Z. 
 * All other characters (e.g., full stops, comma, brackets, numbers, 
 * whitespaces) including special letters like Ä, Ö, Ü, ß, é, are 
 * considered to be not part of a word and can separate words. 
 * 
 * Furthermore, the parser converts all letters to upper case.
